# Am I A Participant? (Gmail)

Check if you are a participant of a conversation in Gmail. Helps you stop sending emails with the wrong address. A red outline around "Reply" and "Reply All" will appear if the currently logged in email is not part of the conversation.

## How Does This Work
Initially this script will wait for Gmails single-page-app to update the DOM (hopefully) and then get the emails that are used in the current conversation. These emails are then compared to the current email logged in and this used to determine if a warning is needed.
